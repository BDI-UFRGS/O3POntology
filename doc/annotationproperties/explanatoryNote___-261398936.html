An action specification is typically a part of some plan specification.<br /><br />2. All actions change the universe in some fashion. That is, they have outcomes, whether desired ones or not. Since desired outcomes are reasons for the existence of an action specification, we might argue that all action specifications are, in fact, plan specifications, with desired outcomes as objectives. However, our intent here is to capture instances of action specifications wherein objectives or desired outcomes are not explicitly stated and to delinate 'plan specifications' as cases where the objectives and the corresponding actions are explicitly stated. This is why the class is asserted directly under the information content entity.<br /><br />3. Although not formalized at this stage, an action specification may prescribe a kind of process in more detail by prescribing the sequence of actions one or more participants are to do or by prescribing the actions persons bearing various roles are to do in bringing about the process. The latter would be relevant in situations where a particular participant bears two (or even more roles) in a process. An example of the latter would be a particular shop floor worker bearing and realizing both the role of the operator and that of the inspector as prescribed by some action specification and as realized in today's occurrences of some punch-press process."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Whereas the BFO term 'disposition refers to all tendencies, powers, habits, skills, potentials, and so forth, that a material entity may possess, a Capability narrows this down by requiring the existence of an Agent that has an interest in the realization of the capability<br /><br />2. This definition does not attempt to capture "task-based" capabilities that an entity may bear -- e.g., a stone's capability to kill when used by some person. Rather, it captures "proper capabilities." See related discussion of "proper functions" in the literature. <br /><br />3. All functions are capabilities and in a future release BFO:Function will be asserted directly under capability. <br /><br />4. Not all capabilities are functions. Capabilities are often added to an artifact by the designer/engineer, or to a biological entity through evolution, as "additional benefits," and are differentiated from function (i.e., purpose). Examples: the air conditioner in your car is a capability but not the function of your car. Yet the function of the car air conditioner certainly forms some material basis of your car's ability to provide a comfortable experience. The ability of your heart to beat fast to support your need to run fast to escape a threat. The decaying stick on the forest lawn does not have the function to be used as a tool, but certainly a chimpanzee<br /> may have an interest in using a stick to extract food from a termite mound."</span>&nbsp;</li>

The inputs and specified outputs of 'computing process' are strictly limited to information content entities. <br />2. While it is true that algorithms can result in an action by an agent that concretizes it (e.g. controller changes the pressure of a valve), the intermediate step is still an information content entity (e.g. action specification) that is 'concretized' in a separate process that results in the action."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Design specification may be a model or a textual or graphical specification.<br /><br />2. This class is not intended to be used to represent the design of planned processes. For this purpose, plan specification should be used.<br /><br />3. Something 'man-made' comprehends those physical and non-physical things that are intentionally created by human beings. Hence the thing specified by a design specification may be either BFO:GDC or BFO:Material Entity.<br /><br />4. A design specification specifies what the thing should be, such as its shape, size, tolerance, and performance but not necessarily how the thing should be made. If it contains information on how a thing should be made, this should be modeled separately through a 'plan specification' that is 'part of' the design specification<br /><br />5. Typically, a design specification satisfies a set of requirements"</span>&nbsp;</li>

This class is intended to be a defined class used for axiomatization and assertion convenience.

By including in the definition that the material artifact is not consumed in the process, the equipment role intentionally excludes entities such as consumables and reagents, which should be modeled separately.<br /><br />2. In the definition, "utilized for carrying out" implies that the function of the given material artifact needs to be realized in the process. That is, entities with the equipment role should not passively participate in the prescribed process. This differentiates 'material artifacts with the equipment role' (a piece of equipment) from material artifacts that are acted upon (transformed or modified) in the given process."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Identifier can be just one designative ICE or consist of a combination of them. It can also be a combination of other types of information; for example, in a particular domain of discourse, a combination of first name and last name can provide sufficient uniqueness for entities in that domain.<br />2. The designative property enforces uniqueness as it is a functional property. In other words, on the instance level, each instance of identifier designates exactly one instance of an entity."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Information content entity is intended to be a class of entities whose instances represent some distinct content or pattern independent from the various ways of conveying it by physical, electronic, or other means. For example, three instances of information bearers -- a bar chart, a color-coded map, and a written report -- each conveying the GDP of Countries for the year 2010, are each different carriers of the same information content. It is this content that is generically dependent upon its carrier. This treatment of information content entity leads to a principle of subtyping based upon the relationship that ICE's have with the entity they are about rather than attributes such as format, language, measurement scale, or media. The latter are treated here as various qualities of the material entities that have them. <br /><br />2. Information content entities are typically textual or schematic."</span>&nbsp;</li>

This definition presupposes that the outputs of a manufacturing process are in every case material artifacts or man-made substances. <br /><br />2. Processes that have as their primary output, something immaterial or informational in nature (digital outputs), such as found in the production of software, will be considered speparately at a later stage.<br /> <br />3.. There are other processes that while they may come into direct contact with a manufactured component or substance and are often considered part of the overall set of activities planned and executed to manufacture something, they are not "transformative" in nature relative to that which is manufactured, and are specifically excluded the definition. Examples include setup, tear down, transporting components or materials between locations, inspection, and so forth.<br />This is addressed by output in the axiom. Setup =&gt; does not have output. Tear down like disassembly should still be considered transformative.<br /><br />4. This definition places no additional restrictions on the output of a manufacturing process in terms of being in a state of completion (completed component or finished good)."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Assemblies that are components for one manufacturer may be final products for another (e.g., the selling of diesel engines is a primary product line of Cummins diesel engine yet a component assembly for its customers, Freightliner Trucks). In other words, the context in which a material entity is used must be considered to determine whether it bears the component role.<br /><br />2. In most manufacturing use cases, material components will be a subclass of 'material artifact'.<br /><br />3. See the expanded definition under the corresponding role class.

This defined class is designed to group material entities according to a very broad criterion and is not intended to be used as a parent class for resource types that can be more specifically asserted under another class.<br /><br />2. Skills and capabilities or other entities in the SDC branch are not resources but they can be considered resources indirectly through their bearer<br /><br />3.

Although the notion of "particular condition"; has not been introduced in this release, the IOF's approach will be to model this as a dependent entity such that at any timeframe during which it exists, it depends on some material entity -- meaning a material state will necessarily "be focused on" a particular condition of some material entity for which the state is ascribed. Condition here would encompass BFO: specifically-dependent continuants (qualities, dispositions and other realizable entities types) as well as site (the absolute or relative location of a material entity). In the future, the coverage will be expanded to include some currently "missing dependent entity types"; including orientation, and cases wherein a material entity is in a particular condition because it has or is in particular composition or configuration (e.g. the setup action of a machine and jig is complete and it is not in a setup/ready-for-run state). <br /><br />2. Unchanging, is intended to encompass not just having a particular condition for the duration of the state, but potentially being value-bound to some constant or even within a given range as prescribed by some design or requirement specification. Specialized sub-types may be introduced to handle such value-based constant and range-bound states and conditions. <br /><br />3. The term as introduced here is not intended to be used for modeling what we might call the "state of a process" (e.g., equilibrium state for chemical, physical and biological processes or steady-state or discrete or continuous production processes), nor for modeling the states of non-real entities (e.g., virtual entities participating in virtual simulation program and any other informational or abstract entities, when they are considered to be in a particular condition). Extensions to the BFO framework as well as further work on 'process characteristic' may be first needed to handle these use cases and such specialized state classes will be introduced in a future release."</span>&nbsp;</li>

The values of the measured value expression are generated during the measurement process that produces the measurement information content entity the measured value expression is a part of. The corresponding parthood axiom is captured in the measurement information content entity class and is not reintroduced in the formal definition here to avoid redundancy.<br /><br />2.

Attribute here comprehends qualities in case the entity the measurement content entity 'is about' is an independent continuant and process characteristics if the entity is a process or temporal region if the entity is a process or process boundary.<br />2. Measurement ICE describes attributes of physical entities. As such, it is not intended to be used for capturing metrics related to strictly digital objects (information content entities in the IOF framework).<br />3. Measurement ICE can contain qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative measurements of the attribute. These values are stored within the measured value expression that is a part of the measurement ICE. <br />4. Measurement ICE can be utilized for both raw and processed measurement data.<br />5. The International Vocabulary of Metrology defines measurement ICE as a "set of values being attributed to a measurand together with any other available relevant information." This implies that, in addition to the actual measurement value, the measurement ICE contains other information(e.g., the entity of interest of which the measurand is the 'attribute of')."</span>&nbsp;</li>

Determining the value here is to be interpreted in the context of qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative measurements. As such, it comprehends both categorical and numerical measurements.<br />2. Typically, the results of measurements are recorded and stored as a measurement information content entity.<br />3. Measurement processes can have as temporal or occurrent parts other measurement processes as well data transformation processes which transform the raw measurement data.<br />4. The entity whose attribute is measured might either participate in the process if it is a continuant or occupy a temporal interval that precedes or partially coincides with the measurement process if it is an occurrent.<br />5. The material entity measuring the attribute must be capable of measuring that attribute. This is axiomatically captured by mandating that the material entity that is measuring the attribute must have a measurement capability."</span>&nbsp;</li>

This class is intended to provide a single framework for representing unit-value pairs and the connection between a value and a particular classification scheme in the case of qualitative values.
