An ontology is OBO Basic if and only if it has the following characteristics:

    AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote """1. Although the notion of "particular condition"; has not been introduced in this release, the IOF's approach will be to model this as a dependent entity such that at any timeframe during which it exists, it depends on some material entity -- meaning a material state will necessarily "be focused on" a particular condition of some material entity for which the state is ascribed. Condition here would encompass BFO: specifically-dependent continuants (qualities, dispositions and other realizable entities types) as well as site (the absolute or relative location of a material entity). In the future, the coverage will be expanded to include some currently "missing dependent entity types"; including orientation, and cases wherein a material entity is in a particular condition because it has or is in particular composition or configuration (e.g. the setup action of a machine and jig is complete and it is not in a setup/ready-for-run state). 

2. Unchanging, is intended to encompass not just having a particular condition for the duration of the state, but potentially being value-bound to some constant or even within a given range as prescribed by some design or requirement specification. Specialized sub-types may be introduced to handle such value-based constant and range-bound states and conditions. 

3. The term as introduced here is not intended to be used for modeling what we might call the "state of a process" (e.g., equilibrium state for chemical, physical and biological processes or steady-state or discrete or continuous production processes), nor for modeling the states of non-real entities (e.g., virtual entities participating in virtual simulation program and any other informational or abstract entities, when they are considered to be in a particular condition). Extensions to the BFO framework as well as further work on 'process characteristic' may be first needed to handle these use cases and such specialized state classes will be introduced in a future release.""" ;

From the second IAO workshop, various comments, [commented on by Alan Ruttenberg 8/6/2009]

unit of measure is a quality, e.g. the length of a ruler.

[We decided to hedge on what units of measure are, instead talking about measurement unit labels, which are the information content entities that are about whatever measurement units are. For IAO we need that information entity in any case. See the term measurement unit label]

[Some struggling with the various subflavors of is_about. We subsequently removed the relation represents, and describes until and only when we have a better theory]

a represents b means either a denotes b or a describes

describe:
a describes b means a is about b and a allows an inference of at least one quality of b

We have had a long discussion about denotes versus describes."""@en,
        """From the second IAO workshop: An attempt at tieing the quality to the measurement datum more carefully.

a is a magnitude means a is a determinate quality particular inhering in some bearer b existing at a time t that can be represented/denoted by an information content entity e that has parts denoting a unit of measure, a number, and b. The unit of measure is an instance of the determinable quality."""@en,

    AnnotationVocabulary:explanatoryNote """1. An action specification is typically a part of some plan specification.

2. All actions change the universe in some fashion. That is, they have outcomes, whether desired ones or not. Since desired outcomes are reasons for the existence of an action specification, we might argue that all action specifications are, in fact, plan specifications, with desired outcomes as objectives. However, our intent here is to capture instances of action specifications wherein objectives or desired outcomes are not explicitly stated and to delinate 'plan specifications' as cases where the objectives and the corresponding actions are explicitly stated. This is why the class is asserted directly under the information content entity.

3. Although not formalized at this stage, an action specification may prescribe a kind of process in more detail by prescribing the sequence of actions one or more participants are to do or by prescribing the actions persons bearing various roles are to do in bringing about the process. The latter would be relevant in situations where a particular participant bears two (or even more roles) in a process. An example of the latter would be a particular shop floor worker bearing and realizing both the role of the operator and that of the inspector as prescribed by some action specification and as realized in today's occurrences of some punch-press process.""" ;

Barry Smith

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting."@en,

Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

A nozzle is often a pipe or tube of varying cross sectional area, and it can be used to direct or modify the flow of a fluid (liquid or gas). Nozzles are frequently used to control the rate of flow, speed, direction, mass, shape, and/or the pressure of the stream that emerges from them. In a nozzle, the velocity of fluid increases at the expense of its pressure energy."""@en .

For example Werner Ceusters 'portions of reality' include 4 sorts, entities (as BFO construes them), universals, configurations, and relations. It is an open question as to whether entities as construed in BFO will at some point also include these other portions of reality.

We may say an occurrent is at its span, in any larger region, and covers any smaller region. Now suppose we have fixed a frame of reference so that we can speak not merely of spatio-temporal but also of spatial regions (places) and temporal regions (times). The spread of an occurrent, (relative to a frame of reference) is the space it exactly occupies, and its spell is likewise the time it exactly occupies. We write 'spr[e]' and `spl[e]' respectively for the spread and spell of e, omitting mention of the frame." .
